## Overview

BattleBugz is a single-player web game built with Django. You manage a roster of bugs, each with unique stats and elemental types. One bug is **active** at a time — that's the bug you take with you to explore locations, forage for food, and challenge other bugs to combat. Battles are fully simulated server-side and their round-by-round logs are stored and viewable after the fact.

---

## Core Features

### 🐝 Bugs
- Create bugs with a **10-point stat allocation system** (HP, Armor, Strength, Mobility, Healing Factor)
- Four elemental types: **Fire 🔥 · Water 💧 · Earth 🪨 · Grass 🌿**
- Each bug has a natural habitat (a location), image, and description
- **Activate** any bug to make it your current active bug
- Edit name, image, and description after creation
- View full stats and battle history per bug

### 📍 Locations
- Create and manage locations, each with its own type and available foods
- Each location can have **resident bugs** (their natural habitat)
- **Forage** at a location with your active bug — a random food is selected and permanently boosts one of the bug's stats
- Challenge any resident bug to a **battle** directly from the location page

### 🍎 Food
- Foods are tied to locations and each boosts a specific stat by a set amount
- Add new foods to a location or remove them individually
- Foods can be permanently deleted or just unlinked from a specific location

### ⚔️ Battles
- Select an opponent bug at a location and start a battle
- Battles are **fully simulated** round-by-round using a deterministic formula:
  - Damage = `max(attacker.strength − defender.armor, 0)`
  - Defenders have a **dodge chance** based on their Mobility stat
  - After surviving a hit, the defender regenerates `healing_factor × 0.5` HP (capped at max)
  - Roles **swap each round** (attacker and defender alternate)
  - Battle ends when one bug reaches 0 HP, or after 100 rounds (stamina draw)
- Full round log stored in the database and displayed in a 3-column layout: attacker · log · defender
- Browse your full battle history with outcomes and timestamps

### 🏠 Homepage
- Displays your **active bug**, the **top bug** by total power, and the **top location** by resident bug count
- Quick-access buttons to all main sections

## Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technology                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Backend     | Python 3.12, Django 6.0           |
| Database    | PostgreSQL (`psycopg2-binary`)     |
| Frontend    | Bootstrap 5.3 (CDN)               |
| Config      | `python-decouple` + `.env` file   |

---

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL server running locally (or remotely)
- `git`

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/BattleBugz.git
cd BattleBugz
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables

Copy the template and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Then edit `.env` — see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below.

### 5. Create the PostgreSQL database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE battlebugz;
```

### 6. Run migrations

This will create all tables **and** load the example data in one step:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create a superuser (optional, for Django Admin)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. Start the development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

## Environment Variables

All secrets and config live in a `.env` file (never committed). Use `.env.template` as a starting point:

| Variable      | Description                                      | Example            |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `SECRET_KEY`  | Django secret key (generate one below)           | `django-insecure-…`|
| `DEBUG`       | Enable debug mode (`True` in dev, `False` in prod) | `True`           |
| `DB_NAME`     | PostgreSQL database name                         | `battlebugz`       |
| `DB_USER`     | PostgreSQL username                              | `postgres`         |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password                              | `yourpassword`     |
| `DB_HOST`     | Database host                                    | `localhost`        |
| `DB_PORT`     | Database port                                    | `5432`             |

**Generate a secret key:**

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

---

## Example Data

Running `python manage.py migrate` automatically seeds the database with example data via `common/migrations/0001_seed_example_data.py`:

**5 Locations** — Hellish Volcano, Mirror Lake, Secret Cave, Wide Pastures, Murkwood

**6 Bugs** — Infernal Wasp (Fire), River Mermaid (Water), Rock Beetle (Earth), Slicer Mantis (Grass), BumbleBee (Earth), Spiky (Grass — starts as active)

**6 Foods** — Sweet Apple, Rock Candy, Hot Pepper, Lemonade, FR E SH A VOCA DO, Strong Pineapple

**2 Sample Battles** — with full round-by-round logs

To undo the seed data:

```bash
python manage.py migrate common zero
```

## Game Mechanics

### Stat Allocation (Bug Creation)

Each new bug gets **10 points** to distribute across 5 stats (0–5 per stat):

| Stat             | Effect                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `max_health_points` | Total HP pool                                  |
| `armor`          | Reduces incoming damage each hit                    |
| `strength`       | Raw attack damage per round                         |
| `mobility`       | Increases dodge chance (`mobility / (mobility + 100)`) |
| `healing_factor` | Regenerates `healing_factor × 0.5` HP after surviving a hit |

Base stats of **20 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 5** are applied before your allocation, so every bug starts viable.

### Battle Formula

```
dodge_chance  = defender.mobility / (defender.mobility + 100)
damage        = max(attacker.strength - defender.armor, 0)
regen per hit = defender.healing_factor × 0.5   (capped at max HP)
```

Attacker and defender **swap roles every round**. Maximum 100 rounds — if both bugs survive, the one still standing (higher HP) is declared the winner.

### Foraging

Foraging picks a **random food** from the location's food list and permanently increases the active bug's corresponding stat by `food.increase_amount`. The event is logged in `FoodEvent` for history tracking.
